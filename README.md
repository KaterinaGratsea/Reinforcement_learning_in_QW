# Reinforcement_learning_in_QW
 We implement the off-policy Qlearning algorithm with the goal of maximizing the hybrid entanglement between the walker and the coin degree of freedom in an one-dimensional quantum walk. 
 
# Results

We use the Schmidt norm as a measure of entanglement which is the reward at the final time step of the quantum walk evolution. The Schmidt norm reached after an evolution of 5-step (blue), 7-step (orange), and 15-step (green) quantum walk with the optimal sequence (solid line) obtained by the Qlearning algorithm and the universal entangling sequence (dotted dashed line) is shown below
